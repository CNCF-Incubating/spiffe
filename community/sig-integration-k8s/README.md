### Goals:
* Provide SPIFFE framework (node/workload identity, and attestion service with providers) to adapt to Kubernetes workloads
* Work with Kubernetes community
	- [Kubernets Auth SIG](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-auth)
	- [Kubernetes Identity WG](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCK-1_Zy2WfsrMBJkdaV72d2hidaxZBhS5YQHAgscPI/edit)

### Non Goals:
* It is not a goal to replace what Kubernetes [provides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/authentication/) or will provide
* The goal to define SPIFFE components is out of scope of this SIG, you may want to consider participating at [these](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/community/sig-components/README.md) places.
