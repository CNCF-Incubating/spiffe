# SIG Integration gRPC

A Special Interest Group (SIG) focused on ways of integrating SPIFFE into [gRPC](http://grpc.io/). Exploring how gRPC can work efficiently with SPIFFE to consume SVIDs and rotate them safely. We encourage attendees to show up in-person for these meetings, even though each meeting will have video conferencing (and be recorded).
